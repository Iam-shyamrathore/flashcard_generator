1,What is electric current?,"Electric current is the net amount of charge (positive minus negative) flowing across a given area in a specific direction per unit time. Mathematically, it's defined as the limit of the ratio of the net charge (DQ) flowing across a cross-section of a conductor to the time interval (Dt) as Dt approaches zero: I = lim (Dt->0) DQ/Dt.  The SI unit is the ampere (A).",Easy,Electric Current,Physics
2,What is Ohm's Law?,"Ohm's Law states that the voltage (V) across a conductor is directly proportional to the current (I) flowing through it, provided the physical conditions (temperature, etc.) remain constant.  Mathematically, V = IR, where R is the resistance of the conductor.  It implies a linear relationship between voltage and current.",Medium,Ohm's Law,Physics
3,How does the resistance of a conductor relate to its dimensions?,"The resistance (R) of a conductor is directly proportional to its length (l) and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area (A).  This is expressed as R = ρl/A, where ρ (rho) is the resistivity of the material.  Doubling the length doubles the resistance; doubling the area halves the resistance.",Medium,Resistance and Dimensions,Physics
4,What is resistivity and what are its units?,Resistivity (ρ) is a material property that quantifies its opposition to the flow of electric current. It is the resistance of a conductor of unit length and unit cross-sectional area. The SI unit of resistivity is the ohm-meter (Ω⋅m).,Medium,Resistivity,Physics
5,How does temperature affect the resistivity of a metallic conductor?,"The resistivity of a metallic conductor generally increases with increasing temperature.  This is because the increased thermal motion of the atoms in the metal leads to more frequent collisions between the electrons and the atoms, impeding the flow of current.",Medium,Temperature Dependence of Resistivity,Physics
6,What is drift velocity?,"Drift velocity (vd) is the average velocity of charge carriers (e.g., electrons) in a conductor due to an applied electric field.  It's the net velocity of the electrons superimposed on their random thermal motion.  Electrons drift slowly in a direction opposite to the electric field.",Medium,Drift Velocity,Physics
7,What is the relationship between current density (j) and drift velocity (vd)?,"Current density (j) is the amount of current per unit area. The relationship is given by j = nqv_d, where n is the number density of charge carriers, q is the charge of each carrier, and vd is the drift velocity. The current density vector is in the same direction as the electric field.",Hard,Current Density,Physics
8,What are Kirchhoff's rules and what do they describe?,Kirchhoff's rules are two fundamental laws used to analyze electrical circuits: (1) **Junction Rule:** The sum of currents entering a junction (node) equals the sum of currents leaving it (conservation of charge). (2) **Loop Rule:** The algebraic sum of potential changes around any closed loop in a circuit is zero (conservation of energy).,Hard,Kirchhoff's Rules,Physics
9,What is the Wheatstone bridge and what is its purpose?,"The Wheatstone bridge is a circuit used to measure an unknown resistance accurately. It consists of four resistors arranged in a diamond shape, with a voltage source across one diagonal and a galvanometer (or other current-measuring device) across the other.  The balance condition (no current through the galvanometer) allows for the calculation of an unknown resistance.",Hard,Wheatstone Bridge,Physics
10,What is the electromotive force (emf) of a cell?,"The electromotive force (emf, ε) of a cell is the potential difference across the terminals of the cell when no current is flowing (open circuit). It represents the work done by the cell per unit charge to move charge from the negative to the positive terminal.  It is measured in volts (V).",Medium,EMF and Cells,Physics
