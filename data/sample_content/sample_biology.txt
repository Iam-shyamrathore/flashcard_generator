Cell Structure and Function

The cell is the basic unit of life. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells. There are two main types of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

Prokaryotic Cells:
- Do not have a nucleus
- Genetic material is freely floating in the cytoplasm
- Examples include bacteria and archaea
- Typically smaller and simpler in structure

Eukaryotic Cells:
- Have a membrane-bound nucleus
- Genetic material is contained within the nucleus
- Examples include plant cells, animal cells, and fungal cells
- More complex internal structure with organelles

Key Organelles and Their Functions:
a
Nucleus: Controls cell activities and contains DNA. Often called the "control center" of the cell.

Mitochondria: Powerhouse of the cell. Produces ATP through cellular respiration. Plant and animal cells both have mitochondria.

Chloroplasts: Found only in plant cells. Site of photosynthesis where light energy is converted to chemical energy.

Ribosomes: Protein synthesis occurs here. Can be free-floating or attached to endoplasmic reticulum.

Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):
- Rough ER: Has ribosomes attached, involved in protein synthesis
- Smooth ER: No ribosomes, involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification

Golgi Apparatus: Modifies, packages, and ships proteins from the ER. Acts like a post office for the cell.

Lysosomes: Contain digestive enzymes. Break down waste materials and worn-out organelles. Found mainly in animal cells.

Cell Membrane: Semi-permeable barrier that controls what enters and exits the cell. Made of phospholipid bilayer.

Cell Wall: Found in plant cells, fungi, and bacteria. Provides structural support and protection. Made of cellulose in plants.

Vacuoles: Storage organelles. Plant cells have one large central vacuole, while animal cells have several smaller vacuoles.

Cell Transport:
Passive transport does not require energy and includes diffusion and osmosis.
Active transport requires energy (ATP) to move substances against concentration gradients.
